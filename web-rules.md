# How to Web

"Web" refers to the [Web platform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_platform).

It is possible to build stunning things on the web. But there are nuances which can cause headaches. Even worse, security risks. All Do's and Don'ts I personally stumbled across while working with the web, are written down in this small collection as "rules".

### why

The Web is a giant mess, there I said it. Yes it's awesome, and the worlds best system to develop apps. But the guy who initially made it, and the following teams and organisations who build and shaped it, lacked any kind of vision, for what the tool could become. Because of that, fundamental things about the Web are flawed. Which also makes a lot of technical folks not take it serious. Completely missing out on it's capabilities. Arch Linux users don't write javascript, they post memes about how HTML is not a language.

## HTML

- Force HTML 5 with `<!DOCTYPE html>`.
- Lint with https://validator.w3.org/

## CSS

## Javascript

- Don't use the `var` declaration statement
